## 🐱🐶 Image Classification: Cats vs. Dogs with Transfer Learning
This tutorial demonstrates how to classify images of cats and dogs using transfer learning from a pre-trained deep learning model.

## 🚀 Overview
A pre-trained model is a saved neural network previously trained on a large dataset, typically for image classification tasks. Instead of training from scratch, we leverage this model’s learned feature maps to classify new images efficiently.

## 🔹 Key Concepts Covered
Transfer Learning: Adapting a pre-trained network to a new task.
Feature Extraction: Using learned patterns from large datasets.
Fine-Tuning: Customizing the model for better accuracy.

## 🎯 Why Transfer Learning?
Training a deep model from scratch requires huge datasets and computational power. By using a pre-trained model, we:
✅ Save time
✅ Improve accuracy
✅ Reduce training costs
